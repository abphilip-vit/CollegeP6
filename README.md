# College: Intruder ReID and Tracking

Traditional methods of surveillance needed a revamp to ensure more security by detecting factors that even humans may miss. The project is about simplifying hours of search needed by multiple personnel rewinding and forwarding surveillance tapes to find a small detail, which often gets missed most of the time. Having automation in this field will greatly improve the efficiency of the search meanwhile decreasing the human error factor. The utility value to the society can be measured by the increase in safety and the decrease in the effort which is required to produce that and hence the overall impact is very high if the project is implemented properly after optimizing and eliminating the errors using higher grade machinery for computation.

The biggest issue with the current re-identification methods is that they do not have the detection feature.  Of all the research papers I have gone through, there are a lot of comparisons on identifying the better re-ID software, identifying the dataset that will yield the best output, and recognizing the algorithm that can give better accuracy. The biggest limitation of all these researches is that they have made their standard input as an image. In a real-world scenario, that is not the case. Surveillance tapes are in video format. So, combining the detection algorithm, which takes the input as a video and gives the output as an image with a bounded box on the person, and the re-identification algorithm, which takes in the resized images after cropping the person inside the bounding boxes, not only makes it very accurate (due to the combination of accuracies of both algorithms) but also makes it much more realistic for implementation.
